An agent can do more than just respond to a prompt — it can **take actions** to find information or get things done.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- ✅ Install [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- ✅ Configure your API key to use the Gemini model\n- ✅ Build your first simple agent\n- ✅ Run your agent and watch it use a tool (like Google Search) to answer a question\n\n**ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n\nThis notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only. You **do not** need to submit it anywhere to complete the course.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 📖 Get started with Kaggle Notebooks\n\nIf this is your first time using Kaggle Notebooks, welcome! You can learn more about using Kaggle Notebooks [in the documentation](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/notebooks).\n\nHere's how to get started:\n\n**1. Verify Your Account (Required)**\n\nTo use the Kaggle Notebooks in this course, you'll need to verify your account with a phone number.\n\nYou can do this in your [Kaggle settings](https://www.kaggle.com/settings).\n\n**2. Make Your Own Copy**\n\nTo run any code in this notebook, you first need your own editable copy.\n\nClick the `Copy and Edit` button in the top-right corner.\n\n![Copy and Edit button](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/Images/5gdai_sc_1.png)\n\nThis creates a private copy of the notebook just for you.\n\n**3. Run Code Cells**\n\nOnce you have your copy, you can run code.\n\nClick the ▶️ Run button next to any code cell to execute it.\n\n![Run cell button](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/Images/5gdai_sc_2.png)\n\nRun the cells in order from top to bottom.\n\n**4.

Add the key to Kaggle Secrets**\n\nNext, you will need to add your API key to your Kaggle Notebook as a Kaggle User Secret.\n\n1. In the top menu bar of the notebook editor, select `Add-ons` then `Secrets`.\n2. Create a new secret with the label `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.\n3. Paste your API key into the \"Value\" field and click \"Save\".\n4. Ensure that the checkbox next to `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is selected so that the secret is attached to the notebook.\n\n**3.

ADK is optimized for Gemini and the Google ecosystem but is model-agnostic and deployment-agnostic, allowing compatibility with other frameworks.
