# 🤖 Kaggle × Google: 5-Day Intensive AI Agent Course
## Overview

This repository documents my learning journey through the Kaggle × Google “AI Agents” 5-Day Intensive Course (2025) — an official hands-on program designed to introduce developers and researchers to Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Gemini API.

Throughout the course, participants learn how to design, orchestrate, and deploy AI agents that can reason, take actions, and collaborate to solve complex tasks.
All notebooks, notes, and implementations are based on the official Google ADK tutorials and my own reflections and experiments.
